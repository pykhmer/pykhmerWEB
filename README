Now I just finished the pykhmer website 80% done and published on
https://github.com/.

In this milestone (Called milestone1) woks fine with  the base
functionality of Django-CMS:
**********************
    1-100% using django-CMS.(python,Django Framework)
    2-Currently I am using Sqlite.of cause you can use other
(Mysql,Postgres...)
    3-Template layout (html+css+js) have already defined (keep it
simple).

So you can check or clone from the expository(https://github.com/
pykhmer/pykhmerWEB) with the following address:

git@github.com:pykhmer/pykhmerWEB.git
I am using git so of cause you need the git software(download+install)
Read http://help.github.com/win-git-installation/ to know more about
git,

In the next milestone it will commit by all of you .and we hope to get
the new version.

Please checkout the project and continue with the next milestone:
